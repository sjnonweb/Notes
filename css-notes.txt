//CSS Notes

* This "nth-child" pseudo class selector example "p:nth-child(3)" will target p which is the third child of its parent, not 3rd p child of its parent.

* In "display:inline" property, all the elements are placed in same line but they dont keep their dimension, to be able to have their dimension we need to use "display:inline-block". Inline value is suitable for the elements which are blocks by default, such as headers and paragraphs.

* If an element is positioned absolute this element will position itself according to its parent which has position absolute. if there is no such element it will position according to outermost element, i.e. HTML.

* If an element is positioned relative, it would position itself according to the position it would otherwise have been. 

* "clear" property of css is used to make a div or any element steer clear of any of the element on its either side, its valid value can be "left", "right" or "both"

* Not all CSS properties are inherited, because it doesn’t make sense for some of them to be. For instance, margins are not inherited, since it’s unlikely that a child element should need the same margins as its parent. e.g. body has a margin specified by default.

* Inline elements cannot be center aligned e.g. <img> is an inline element. We can center it by changing it to a block element that is by adding this property to <img>: "display: block"

* Inline elements by default have a margin while block elements dont

* With all the inline elements margin is applied only to the left and right side, <img> being an exception while in case of block elemens margin is applied to all the sides.

* Inline elements will have an added margin of both the elements that is the margin of itself added with the margin of element it is being margined from. While block element will only have the margin which is larger of two.

* inline-block property is hybrid between inline and block. inline-block element will get height and width property of block element but it will not create a new line before and after it, that is it is inheriting inline property here.

* nth-child pseudo selector: nth-child(odd),nth-child(even), nth-child(2),nth-child(2n),nth-child(2n+3)="start out with selecting 3rd element and then select every 2nd element after that"

* rgba() stands for red,green,blue,alpha. where alpha is opacity.

* text-shadow, box-shadow

* linear-gradient
